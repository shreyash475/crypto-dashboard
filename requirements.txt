streamlit
requests
pandas
```

**That's it!**

**Why we need this:**
- Your computer already has these installed
- Streamlit Cloud starts fresh
- This file says: "Install these before running my app"

**Think of it as:** The grocery list for your app's recipe

#### Visualisation Element
Side-by-side:
- Left: Simple text file showing the three lines
- Right: Explanation showing each library's purpose (streamlit=framework, requests=API calls, pandas=data handling)

#### Speaker Notes
- 2 min
- Super simple file, just list library names
- One library per line
- Only list what your app actually uses
- Don't include Python built-ins (like `datetime`)
- Have learners create this file in their project folder
- Same folder as crypto_app.py
- Save with exact name: requirements.txt (no capitals)

### 29 - Preparing Your App File
#### Slide Content
**Best practices before deploying:**

**1. Name your file clearly:**
- `app.py` or `crypto_app.py` ✓
- `test123.py` or `untitled.py` ✗

**2. Test locally one more time:**
```
streamlit run crypto_app.py
